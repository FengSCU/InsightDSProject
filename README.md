## Insight Project: Neighborhood Finder

### Project Description
Build data pipeline to join mortgage data with neighborhood data to provide user real estate purchase suggestions.


### Business Case
Homeownership is one of core values in the American culture. Most people might purchase houses at some stages. Home purchase is long and complicated process, even during research phase. People need to go back and forth to find information from multiple places. It's inefficient. Why not have a platform to combine those resources? That's the reason I create Neightborhood finder, an interactive and informative platform to help people identify affortable neighborhood that shorten the home purchase process. Real estate agents can also utilize the data to present purchase opportunity more clearly.
